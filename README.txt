Thank you all for letting me work on this project, I’ve really enjoyed toying with d3 and look forward to working more with it. A couple things that I feel I could have improved had I more time:
- I was having trouble querying the single ‘data.csv’ file to shape the data appropriately, and ultimately hand-made multiple data as opposed to simply working with a single set. I would ideally not do this.
- I had some trouble with smoothly transitioning between data sets, and ultimately removed and rendered new graphs as opposed to transitioning.
- I would have liked to organize my javascript files more modularly

Thank you all for your consideration and I look forward to your feedback.


Instructions for operation:
